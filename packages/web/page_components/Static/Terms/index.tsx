          <h4>Class Action Waiver</h4>
          <p>
            Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on
            an individual basis; class arbitrations and
            class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE
            PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY
            IN EACH INDIVIDUAL&apos;S CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
            MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE
            PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION
            AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Company agree
            otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
            person&apos;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of
            a representative or class proceeding.

            your access to the Site and the related services or any portion
            thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent permitted
            by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of
            Delaware and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and
            venue of courts in Delaware in all disputes arising out of or
            relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in
            any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of
            these Terms, including, without limitation, this section.
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
            relationship exists between you and Company as a result of this
            agreement or use of the Site. Company&apos;s performance of this
            agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing
            contained in this agreement is in derogation of Company&apos;s right
            to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or
            requirements relating to your use of the Site or information
            provided to or gathered by Company with respect to such use. If any
            part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable
            pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the
            warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then
            the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by
            a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent
            of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall
            continue in effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the
            entire agreement between the user and Company with respect to the
            Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications
            and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user
            and Company with respect to the Site. A printed version of this
            agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be
            admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
            relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the
            same conditions as other business documents and records originally
            generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to
            the parties that this agreement and all related documents be written
            in English.
